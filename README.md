## Introduction:
----------------------------------------------------------------
RMP is a python web scraping project that extracts all the professor and school data off ratemyprofessors.com and writes the data into a CSV file.
Rate My Professors is the largest online destination for students to research and rate professors, colleges, and universities across the United States.

## Getting Started

Download the project files and run main.py
There are multiple options you can select in the menu. 

Configure ID List: Retrieves all School and Professor IDs     from RMP and writes them to a text file.

Retrieve School Data: Retrieves all School IDs only and write to a text file.

Retrieve Teacher Data: Retrieves all Professor IDs from RMP and writes them to a text file.

Complete RMP Data: Retrieves all data from RMP and writes to a CSV file. (This will essentially do all the above and extrieve all other data relating to Schools and Professors)
